"""Windowing of time series into training instances.

The model is trained on fixed-length windows of ``context_length + forecast_length``
periods sliced out of each location's series. The classes here turn the dense
``(features, target)`` arrays from [`transforms`][chap_ar.transforms] into those
windows and iterate over them.

Each window yields three arrays:

- ``x`` — features over the whole window (context + forecast),
- ``ar_y`` — the (NaN-interpolated) observed target over the **context** only,
  which is fed back in as the auto-regressive input,
- ``y`` — the raw target over the whole window, used as the training label.
